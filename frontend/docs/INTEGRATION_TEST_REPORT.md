### ⚠️ Issues Found

#### Settings Component Test Failures
**Issue**: Minor UI element identification failures  
**Impact**: Low - Does not affect functionality  
**Details**: Some test selectors need updating for the Settings page

```
FAIL src/pages/__tests__/Settings.test.tsx
  × Should handle reset button click
    - Expected element with text 'reset' not found
    - Actual button text is 'Restablecer' or similar
```

**Recommendation**: Update test selectors to match actual UI text

#### Payment Integration Tests
**Issue**: Limited to mock data only  
**Impact**: Medium - Real payment testing needed  
**Details**: Payment processing tests only use mock Stripe integration

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement Stripe test mode integration
- Add end-to-end payment flow testing
- Verify webhook handling
